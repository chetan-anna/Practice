# üè≠ Factory Pattern Overview

The **Factory Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses or logic to alter the type of objects that will be created.

---

## üìå Definition

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

---

## üéØ Intent

- Encapsulate object creation logic
- Promote loose coupling between client and product classes
- Support **Open/Closed Principle** ‚Äì open for extension, closed for modification

---

## üß± Structure

```
Client --> Factory --> Product
                   ‚Ü≥ ConcreteProductA
                   ‚Ü≥ ConcreteProductB
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

- **Product (Interface or Abstract Class)**: Defines the interface of objects the factory creates.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the Product interface.
- **Factory (Creator)**: Declares the factory method.
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

---

## üß® Use Cases

- When object creation is complex or conditional.
- When the client code should be decoupled from actual object classes.
- Useful in frameworks and libraries where exact types aren't known until runtime.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to introduce new product types
- Centralized object creation logic

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks

- May introduce too many small classes
- Slightly increases complexity

---

## üî§ Example (Java)

```java
// Product
interface Animal {
    void speak();
}

// Concrete Products
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}

// Factory
class AnimalFactory {
    public static Animal getAnimal(String type) {
        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "dog": return new Dog();
            case "cat": return new Cat();
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown type");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üí° Java 8 Functional Style Example

```java
Map<String, Supplier<Animal>> animalMap = new HashMap<>();
animalMap.put("dog", Dog::new);
animalMap.put("cat", Cat::new);

Animal animal = animalMap.get("dog").get(); // Woof!
```

## üìö Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory** ‚Äì For families of related products
- **Builder** ‚Äì For step-by-step object creation
- **Prototype** ‚Äì For cloning pre-created objects

---

## üß† Summary

The Factory Pattern is essential in designing scalable, flexible systems. It's especially useful in test automation, plugin systems, or when using AI agents that must create different objects dynamically.
